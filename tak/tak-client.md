# TAK Client Setup Guide

This document provides information on setting up a TAK (Team Awareness Kit) client using Docker containers.

## Overview

The TAK client allows you to connect to TAK servers for situational awareness, location sharing, and data exchange. This setup uses Docker to simplify deployment and management.

## Requirements

- Linux, macOS, or Windows with Docker installed
- Internet connection
- Network connectivity via ZeroTier or Tailscale
- TAK server connection information

## Setup Process

The `tak_setup.py` script automates the client setup process. Key steps include:

1. Installing and configuring Docker
2. Setting up networking via ZeroTier or Tailscale
3. Deploying TAK client container
4. Configuring connection to the TAK server
5. (Optional) Setting up ArgusTAK integration

## Client Types

There are several TAK client applications available:

- **ATAK**: Android Team Awareness Kit (for Android devices)
- **iTAK**: iOS Team Awareness Kit (for iOS devices)
- **WinTAK**: Windows Team Awareness Kit (for Windows PCs)
- **TAK-CIV**: Civilian version of TAK

This setup focuses on containerized TAK client applications that can run on Linux servers or desktops.

## Connection to TAK Server

To connect to a TAK server, you'll need:

1. Server address (IP or domain name)
2. Server port (typically 8443 or 8446)
3. Client certificate (if required by the server)
4. Authentication credentials (if required)

## Using ArgusTAK

ArgusTAK enables connection to existing TAK networks. If using ArgusTAK:

1. Obtain ArgusTAK connection details from your administrator
2. Configure the client with the provided settings
3. Verify connectivity using provided test procedures

## Troubleshooting

Common issues:

1. **Connection failures**: Verify server address and port
2. **Certificate errors**: Ensure client certificate is properly installed
3. **Network issues**: Check ZeroTier/Tailscale connectivity
4. **Docker problems**: Verify Docker is running with `docker info`

## Security Considerations

- Keep client software updated
- Protect your authentication credentials
- Be mindful of sharing sensitive information
- Use encrypted connections when possible
- Consider network security when operating in the field
